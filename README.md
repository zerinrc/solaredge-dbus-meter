# solaredge-dbus-meter
Integrate SolarEdge meter into [Victron Energies Venus OS](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus)

**Not documented yet**. Based on https://github.com/fabian-lauer/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter

## Purpose
The pourpose of this software is to integrate my SolarEdge HD-Wave SE6000H with my Victron MultiPlus II without using an additional energy meter.



## How it works
### My setup
- SolarEdge HD-Wave SE6000H
- Victron MultiPlus II 50000
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B runing Venus OS
- RS485 CAN HAT for Raspberry
- Custom 3D printed case for Raspberry + HAT + RJ45
- Pylotech batts


to be completed...

### Details / Process
As mentioned above the script is inspired by @RalfZim fronius smartmeter implementation.
So what is the script doing:
- Running as a service
- connecting to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.grid.http_40`
- After successful DBus connection Shelly 3EM is accessed via REST-API - simply the /status is called and a JSON is returned with all details
  A sample JSON file from Shelly 3EM can be found [here](docs/shelly3em-status-sample.json)
- Serial/MAC is taken from the response as device serial
- Paths are added to the DBus with default value 0 - including some settings like name, etc
- After that a "loop" is started which pulls Shelly 3EM data every 750ms from the REST-API and updates the values in the DBus

Thats it üòÑ

## Install & Configuration
### Get the code
Just grap a copy of the main branche and copy them to `/data/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter`.
After that call the install.sh script.

The following script should do everything for you:
```
wget https://github.com/fabian-lauer/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter-main /data/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter
chmod a+x /data/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter/install.sh
/data/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter/install.sh
rm main.zip
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Check configuration after that - because service is already installed an running and with wrong connection data (host, username, pwd) you will spam the log-file

### Change config.ini
Within the project there is a file `/data/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter/config.ini` - just change the values - most important is the host, username and password in section "ONPREMISE". More details below:

| Section  | Config vlaue | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DEFAULT  | AccessType | Fixed value 'OnPremise' |
| DEFAULT  | SignOfLifeLog  | Time in minutes how often a status is added to the log-file `current.log` with log-level INFO |
| ONPREMISE  | Host | IP or hostname of on-premise Shelly 3EM web-interface |
| ONPREMISE  | Username | Username for htaccess login - leave blank if no username/password required |
| ONPREMISE  | Password | Password for htaccess login - leave blank if no username/password required |
